As much as i'd enjoy making money off selling this game, I totally am open for giving people the
opportunity to expand on my work creatively.

Derivative Work - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative_work

"A typical example of a derivative work received for registration in the Copyright Office
 is one that is primarily a new work but incorporates some previously published material.
 This previously published material makes the work a derivative work under the copyright law.
 To be copyrightable, a derivative work must be different enough from the original to be
 regarded as a "new work" or must contain a substantial amount of new material.
 Making minor changes or additions of little substance to a preexisting work will not qualify
 the work as a new version for copyright purposes. The new material must be original
 and copyrightable in itself. Titles, short phrases, and format, for example, are not copyrightable."
