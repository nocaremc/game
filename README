Here is the code for my second attempt at a game.
My last attempt went well, but I did hit some snags for sure.

This time I elevated the bar even more.
I really should just make an easier game but this is more fun.

My goal here was to challenge myself by sticking to the "no complex libraries" rule
and to do so with opengl.

I've mostly stuck to that...
I'm using LWJGL for my opengl implementation.
Slick-2D for some various image related type things.
Truetype fonts were just too good to pass up. 
Using google GSON for smexy json usage

Anyway, the idea here is to create a mostly-lightweight 2D game
featuring 3D graphics. All graphics created in blender and/or gimp
if not pure code.

This is pretty ameteur, so be nice and enjoy.
