I have to mention here, since without an internet connection I cannot properly attribute
credit where due.
The base mesh for casey here was taken from blendswap under the title "Body - Update", and other than that I know the Object's name is Eve.

Origionally I used "Sunny" by shadowfoxqx, as I loved her body... haha. But after carefully reading the license I decided against it. It's under
free use, but limits commercial use. I don't expect a mainstream game, but I avoid any issues where I can...
Anyway, I lobbed her head off and used eve's, and I quite liked it. But had to scrap that.

I chose eve because her mesh is extremely low polygon, but looks wonderful. A full body AND HEAD with well defined features.
She is a good base, but is also defined enough to avoid heavy modification. 
Without a subsurf, she comes in at a stunning 2.3k vertices. Head and body, and she looks wonderful. One level of subsurf takes her to 
9.2k. I can certainly make use of no-subsurf in my game, and single subsurf for making clothing.

I will most certainly update this with the origional creators name, link, anything else he/she desires. I am most impressed by it,
and hope that I am able to use her in my game.
