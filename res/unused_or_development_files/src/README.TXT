All files in here are code I wrote, but did not end up using.
Some of it I could not bear to trash.

At time of writing, the single file was FontRenderer.java
It uses an image to create a font. Had fun creating, and seeing it in action.
In the end it simply was not good enough for me to use, and I used Slick2D's UnicodeFont class instead.
