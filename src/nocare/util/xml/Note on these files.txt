nocare.util.xml

These XML files were taken straight from Slick2D.
As I was unable to find any type of license packaged with the compiled or source release of Slick2D
I felt that this was ok.

I had been trying to parse xml, and after getting it working I found this collection. It very nicely compacts the code I was already using.
So I threw them into my own package, and have since been modifying and extending their use.

Note: I now include Slick2D... so I should really get around to extending and overriding where need be.
